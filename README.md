# Laerad: Eliminate Single-Use Abstractions

### What's in a name?

This gem combines Thor with SyntaxTree. Combining Thor with trees made me think
of Yggdrasil, the world tree of Norse mythology, but there's already a gem by
that name. Laerad is an Anglicization of another Norse mythology tree name. It's
[unclear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A6ra%C3%B0r#Theories) how distinct
this tree is from Yggdrasil — could be another name for the same tree, could
be a separate but related tree — but that's usually how things are with
mythologies.
